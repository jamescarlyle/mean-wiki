mean-wiki
=========
This is an implementation of a number of technologies - the MEAN stack.
It is full of bugs and is very fluid, so feel free to observe but I recommend not using this code until it is more formally tested

Running tests (I'll figure out .md syntax later)

1. Unit tests
a. From the project root, "karma start karma.conf.js"

2. E2E tests
a. From the project root, start Selenium with "webdriver-manager start"
b. From the tests directory, start Protractor tests with "protractor conf.js" - will run the tests in spec.js
